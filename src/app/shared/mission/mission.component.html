        Grow & Tell’s mission is to provide Speech-Language Pathology services, including the prevention, screening, assessment,
        treatment, and counseling/collaboration of communication disorders to clients in infancy through adolescents. Grow
        & Tell aims to deliver individualized, evidenced based and developmentally supported services to clients, while also
        providing support to their families. We believe familial support and involvement through the therapy process is essential
        for carryover and generalization of skills from the therapy setting to everyday routines and activities. Grow & Tell
        involves the parents/family in the therapy process by teaching them how to implement strategies that target individualized
        goals. Grow & Tell delivers services at an office location, but also within the client’s home, determined on an individual
        basis and dependent on the age and disability of the client. Therapy services are delivered through a play based
        approach (infants & toddlers), and/or a traditional drill-based approach (school age & adolescents), depending on
        the age and needs of the client.
